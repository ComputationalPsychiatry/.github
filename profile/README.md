TAPAS is a collection of software tools intended to support the development of computational assays (Translational Neuromodeling) and their clinical application in Computational Psychiatry, Neurology and Psychosomatics.
For a general overview of the TAPAS toolbox suite, including its mission, please refer to:

Currently, TAPAS includes the following packages:

- [ActionModels.jl](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/ActionModels.jl): A Julia package for behavioural modeling
- [ActiveInference.jl](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/ActiveInference.jl): Computational modeling of active inference.
- [CEODE](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/CEODE): Continuous Extension of ODE methods. A toolbox for integration of delay differential equations for DCM for EEG/MEG.
- [genbed](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/genbed): A Python package for data exploration and classification as part of the generative embedding pipeline.
- [hgf-toolbox](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/hgf-toolbox): The Hierarchical Gaussian Filter; Bayesian inference on computational processes from observed behaviour.
- [HierarchicalGaussianFiltering.jl](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/HierarchicalGaussianFiltering.jl): The Julia implementation of the generalised hierarchical Gaussian filter
- [PhysIO](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/PhysIO): Physiological Noise Correction for fMRI.
